Natty is a natural language date parser written in Java.  Given a date
expression, natty will apply standard language recognition and translation
techniques to produce a list of corresponding dates with optional parse and
syntax information.

This is a fork from https://github.com/joestelmach/natty to update the dependencies
and include any bug fixes
